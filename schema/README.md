# Schemas

Schemas are used to provide intellisense/autcomplete when creating indexers, indexes, datasources, skillsets, or synonym maps.

The schemas are derived from the `searchService.json` file from [https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/blob/master/specification/search/data-plane/Microsoft.Azure.Search.Service/stable/2019-05-06/searchservice.json). The file is included in this repo only to make it easy to perform a diff and update the schemas as necessary.
